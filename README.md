# Network Traffic Analyzer & Monitor

A simple tool to capture, analyze, and visualize network traffic using Python and Streamlit.  
Monitor live network packets, view protocol distribution, top talkers, and analyze traffic trends over time.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Capture Packets**
   - Run `traffic_analyzer.py` to start capturing packets from your network interface.
   - Ensure you set your Wi-Fi interface/IP configuration as required.

2. **Visualize Traffic**
   - Run `visualize_streamlit.py` in a separate terminal.
   - This opens a Streamlit dashboard in your browser for live monitoring.
